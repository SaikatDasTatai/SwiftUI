<h1 align="center">Learn SwiftUI with Real time Projects</h1>


Yes, I know SwiftUI is a massive new thing that might seem completely alien at first, but in this guide you’ll get lots of hands-on help to guide you through understanding how SwiftUI works so you can be up and running with it fast.

If you’re already familiar with Swift, then everything you know about UIKit is still useful, and will be for a good few years.

Everything you knew about Swift hasn’t changed, so that’s all useful.

Everything you knew about the way iOS apps look and feel hasn’t changed.

What does change with SwiftUI is how we make our apps. Yes, Apple introduced a lot of new things to learn, but once you’re past the basics you’ll start to recognize lots of common ground with UIKit.

So, again: don’t panic. If you’re already proficient with UIKit you can pick up the basics of SwiftUI in less than a day. And if you’re approaching SwiftUI without any knowledge of UIKit, that’s okay too because you’ll find SwiftUI gives you an unparalleled app building experience.

So, trust me: you’ve got this.


## Requirements

1. Please make sure you have macOS 11
