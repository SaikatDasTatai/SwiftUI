## iDine

The project we’ll be making is called iDine, and is a restaurant app that lists items in a menu and helps folks place orders. We’ve designed the project specifically so that it covers as many different techniques as possible to give us a good grounding in how things work in SwiftUI.

## Topics covered
1. Building a menu using List
2. Composing views to create a list row
3. Polishing designs with fonts and colors
4. Displaying a detail screen with NavigationLink
5. Observable objects, environment objects, and @Published
6. Adding items to an order with @EnvironmentObject
7. Adding TabView and tabItem()
8. Bindings and forms
9. Two-way bindings in SwiftUI
10. Formatting interpolated strings in SwiftUI
11. Presenting an alert
12. Adding swipe to delete and EditButton
